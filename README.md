# Online Shopping Behavior That Leads to Revenue
Project for STATS 503 (Multivariate Regression) at University of Michigan, where we were tasked to analyze a public dataset using statistical modeling techniques in R. 

# Project Goal
Determine the features most likely to lead to a sale from the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset from [UCI's ML archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). This README summarizes the major steps and insights, but the finer details will be in [Project---EDA.md](https://github.com/victle/online-shopper-behavior/blob/main/Project---EDA.md).
